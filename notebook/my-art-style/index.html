I focused on getting started and learning the basics of illustration. The result was two years of inconsistent stylistic choices, and arguably it was a good thing.<p>I experimented a lot in this era, trying different ways to approach a problem, and built up muscle memory. I played around with techniques I don't usually do anymore, such as heavy cell shading and thick line art.<p>Around 2022, something changed. I partially reversed my position on art styles. I had become more or less comfortable with the fundamentals. It was natural to want to experiment cultivating a distinctive style. I noticed that a personal style had started to emerge from 2+ years of experimentation. It had traits as follows:<ul><li>Preference for conservative or no amounts of shading and highlights<li>Simple (But not too simple) designs and shapes<li>Contrast between lines and colours<li>Sharp, clear, and thin line art<li>Detail only where it's necessary</ul><p>I realized that my style looked more and more like the Northwest European comics (e.g. Tintin) I grew up with as a child.<p>When I was young, my parents were very strict. They only allowed 2 Hours of internet use (Going as far as banning internet usage completely for the entirety of 2015) and they dislike me watching Television. I also didn't grow up with my generation's other common artists' influence like Flipnote Studio.<p>What I did have was a lot of books and comics. I got into these printed mediums and read them every day after school during this era. I started to draw a little around then, Yet, I never took it seriously.<p>But, the impression I got from these comics from thousands of kilometres away seeped deeply into my style preferences. I have subconsciously developed my art style into something that can be seen as inspired by them.<h2 id=other-inspirations>Other inspirations</h2><p>Of course, Northwest European comics aren't my only inspirations. Others include:<ul><li>Some artists I follow(ed) online (too many to list)<li>Local Indonesian comic artists<li>Impressionist and Post-Impressionist Artworks<li>the Bone comic series<li>Raden Saleh<li>Et cetera.</ul><p>Having a wide range of inspirations is a good idea. To reiterate, I never planned my style to end up looking inspired by Tintin. It kind of happened by itself, and you can still see originality. I didn't simply make a carbon copy of Herg√©'s works but built on top of it with other inspirations.</div></section></div>
