Dania Lovelace is a computer scientist and programmer. She is my fursona and the oldest character I still use today.

## Lore

Dania Lovelace was built as a male android in a government project to revive the Dhole in Indonesia, however due to mishaps during her creation process, she had female programming. She fled the facility she was held in, due to the fact that reprogramming her would erase her personality. She joined a freedom fighting rebellion group who modified her chassis to be more women-like, where she learned programming, cryptography and cyber security and became a blackhat. After a while, they managed to overthrow the government, but Dania felt betrayed by the group after abandoning their principles and fled away. But not before finding the unused female android's chassis (which included an Exoskin that made her look like an Organic) and transferring her mind to it.

She fled away, and started to study Physics in a University. After graduating, she got a full-time job as a Physics programmer at a medium-sized games studio. She met her future wife Sofia Singshow Swift around this time near a Games Conference she was attending in Montreal.

She eventually became one of the leaders of the international Robot Rights movement after revealing that she was a robot all along. and helped drafted the Universal Declaration of Robot Rights, ending most hostility between Organics and Machines.

Today (2055) she still works as a graphics programmer, though at a different studio. She currently lives in an apartment with her lovely wife in Mechathens, a floating city-state run by and made for Robots. She continues to work in computer-related fields and occasionally puts out a research paper or two.

## Trivia

- Dania's forename was suggested by her "mother" (i.e. her creator's wife) for a different robot. She did not have an assigned name at birth.
  - Anglicised, her name is [Diana](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_(mythology)>), the roman goddess of wild animals and the hunt.
- Her last name was only added after she fled her home country, she took it from [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace), the first computer programmer.
  - It was also a bit of an ironic twist, since [Lady Lovelace did not believe Intelligent AI was possible](<https://academic.oup.com/mind/article/LIX/236/433/986238#164226550:~:text=(6)%20Lady%20Lovelace%27s%20Objection>), though most people would suspect she'd change her mind if current evidence was given to her.
- Her current model number is different than her assigned model number, information about her assigned model number has been lost to time.
- The first of my other OCs which she met was Rosa "Rose" Aster-Wei√ü, who she planned to kidnap, yet failed, during a visit to her home country.
- She sometimes draws on her tablet, though mainly just for herself.
- She used a Thinkpad T480 during her rebellion days.
- She sings and dances sometimes, she is pretty good at it.
- She speaks English, Esperanto, Dutch, French, Japanese, and Indonesian.
- Her accent is a modern variation of Transatlantic (though is more influenced by America) with a hint of Swiss French.
- As my (Dania Rifki) fursona, she is the closest character to me, in a way she is an idealised version of me.
