## Who is Dania Rifki?

I'm a Transgender Girl [She/Her] with origins in Jakarta, Indonesia. My main interests being in computer science and related fields. Though I have an interest in basically everything about the world.

I realised I wasn't cisgender in around May 2019, but came fully to accept being a Trans Woman in around December that year. Due to familial and political issues, I have not been able to start transitioning. Though I hope to start transitioning as soon as possible.

I am bisexual and my partner is the lovely [PrimalPeashooter](https://primalpeashooter.github.io/)!

## What is this website?

This is my little personal website; It is where I write thoughts that cannot fit in microblogging platforms, list and showoff my original characters, aggregate links to my profiles on other websites, et cetera.

[My website went through plenty revisions over the years](https://github.com/Kaleidosium/Kaleidosium.github.io/commits/main); I don't think that will end any time soon, but I'm pretty happy with what I have right now. The site design has always fluctuated from being very basic to being more heavy, I think this iteration strikes a good balance between the two.

It is powered by [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a good flexible SSG with a bit of a learning curve.
