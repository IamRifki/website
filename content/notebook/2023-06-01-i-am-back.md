Well, Happy Pride Month everyone! and I think I have something to tell you all.

I'm Polyarmous! and I'm currently in a polyarmous relationship. I'm happy with both of them as my partners and I am in love with them.

I apologise for taking an absence from social media, I had to deal with IRL stuff and I wasn't able to spend much time online!

Another thing, I want to focus on improving my math, so I've been dedicating time to trying to improve my skills, which I have a awful foundation of due to being taught improperly. I hope I can be better at math in the future.

I've also realised I haven't been giving much love to my "core" interests other than Art, and I feel like I get peer pressured to doing art when I really should be focusing on learning integration techniques or write about institutions in Southeast Asia. I still love to draw, but Art to me is a hobby, and doing too much of one thing gets tiring in the long run!
