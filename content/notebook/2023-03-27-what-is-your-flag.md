I've showed my flag to a few people and I decided to make a post about it, here it is:

![Personal Banner of Dania Rifki](/images/notebook/Personal%20Banner_1-Phi.png)

The symbolism of the flag is as follows:

- The Five Stars symbolises Liberalism, technocracy, pragmatism, consequentialism and Internationalism, it also references the olympic flag with the five continental rings
- The Compass Star is a symbol of me as an indivisible individual, but also a hope for a good future
- The Mauveine Purple represents Science and Technology
- The Blue Aster represents Art and Nature
- The two pales being being equal represents the harmonious balance between the mind and the heart

The standard definitions for the colours are:

- White
- Mauveine: Pantone PMS 2602 C
- Blue Aster: Pantone PMS PMS 18-4252 TPG

The aspect ratio of the flag is officially 1:Ï†, but [2:3 is also acceptable](/images/notebook/Personal%20Banner_2-3.png).

This flag is an evolution on many previous designs that I have made through out my time as a vexillophile. Though I am no longer active around these circles, I still consider flags and other symbols of social constructs to be an interesting endeavour.
