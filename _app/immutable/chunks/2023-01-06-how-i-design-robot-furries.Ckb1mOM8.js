I have been guilty of this in the past. You should keep both general perspectives of character illustration and industrial design. But don’t let one of the two overpower the other too much.</p></li> <li><p>Not imagining if the design works within mechanical principles. If the design of the robot makes sense from a mechanical standpoint, like its movement system, it may be a good idea. Otherwise, try revising the design.</p></li> <li><p>Ignoring anatomy in more humanoid designs. If your robot design is more humanoid, please take organic anatomy into consideration. Hence, why I suggested making an organic design first if you’re making a new character.</p></li> <li><p>Fall into a rabbit hole of referencing design with no consideration and overcomplicating the design. It’s fine to deviate from the style you want to mainly do. I encourage experimentation, but I recommend checking if it fits in with the other parts and/or if you are sure you like it.</p></li> <li><p>Exclusively rely on one or a few reference(s). It’s best to have a “big tent” base of references that you like. The design should look less derivative of a single product or thing[^1].</p></li> <li><p>Not considering if the robot design fits within the lore or setting of their world.
