From “clean coders”, RIIR people, and worst of all (like the mob I linked earlier) Stallmanists. Stallmanists are a subset of FOSSbros who want all code to be under the GPLv3 license (<a href="https://news.slashdot.org/story/20/01/24/2211238/free-software-foundation-suggests-microsoft-upcycle-windows-7-as-open-source" rel="nofollow">and of course they make a fool out of themselves</a>). So not only do FOSS maintainers have to deal with all of that (and more), they have to also do their job as programmers (well, FOSS maintainers aren’t always programmers from what I’ve seen, but most of them, anyway) and spend time maintaining, updating, adding new features, while getting almost nothing in return (unless if they have a patreon or OpenCollective).
