There’s everything from steampunk, to 90s retro technology, to futuristic cyberpunk styles. To keep the design more in-line with the style I want.

You could also reference other characters in the style, but be wary of copying too much from them[^1].",z,y,ke="I then put all the references on a mood board[^2], and organise them to my liking.

For example, if I particularly like the grating on something I might ask what function it’s serving, Is it Cooling? Speakers? Weight saving or structural reinforcement? Etc. If one can identify why it was used, they could then implement it for that purpose as well.

None of us will get it right the first time[^5], not here or in any other discipline.</p></li> <li><p>Viewing this in exclusively a character illustration or industrial designer perspective. I have been guilty of this in the past. You should keep both general perspectives of character illustration and industrial design. But don’t let one of the two overpower the other too much.</p></li> <li><p>Not imagining if the design works within mechanical principles. If the design of the robot makes sense from a mechanical standpoint, like its movement system, it may be a good idea. Otherwise, try revising the design.</p></li> <li><p>Ignoring anatomy in more humanoid designs. If your robot design is more humanoid, please take organic anatomy into consideration. Hence, why I suggested making an organic design first if you’re making a new character.</p></li> <li><p>Fall into a rabbit hole of referencing design with no consideration and overcomplicating the design. It’s fine to deviate from the style you want to mainly do. I encourage experimentation, but I recommend checking if it fits in with the other parts and/or if you are sure you like it.</p></li> <li><p>Exclusively rely on one or a few reference(s). It’s best to have a “big tent” base of references that you like. The design should look less derivative of a single product or thing[^1].</p></li> <li><p>Not considering if the robot design fits within the lore or setting of their world. Should be self-explanatory.</p></li>",le,A,Be="Now, Draw",se,F,We="Apply everything that you know and start sketching out the character, and adjust as you complete the design.
